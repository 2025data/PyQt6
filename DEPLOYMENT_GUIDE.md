# IESViewerAudit.py - Production Deployment Guide

## üöÄ Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### 1. Clone or Download
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd PyQt6
git checkout production-ies-viewer-audit
```

### 2. Run Setup Script
**Windows:**
```cmd
start_production.bat
```

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
chmod +x start_production.sh
./start_production.sh
```

The script will:
- Create a virtual environment
- Install dependencies
- Guide you through configuration
- Launch the application

### 3. First-Time Configuration
1. Copy `config_template.py` to `config.py`
2. Update with your Autodesk APS credentials:
   ```python
   APS_CLIENT_ID = 'your_client_id_here'
   APS_CLIENT_SECRET = 'your_client_secret_here'
   ACC_PROJECT_ID = 'b.your-project-id'
   ACC_HUB_ID = 'b.your-hub-id'
   ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No Python found"**
- Install Python 3.8+ from python.org
- Ensure Python is in your system PATH

**"Failed to install dependencies"**
- Check internet connection
- Try: `pip install --upgrade pip`
- For Qt issues on Linux: `apt-get install python3-dev`

**"Authentication failed"**
- Verify APS credentials in config.py
- Check app scopes in APS console
- Ensure 2-legged OAuth is enabled

**"No files found"**
- Verify PROJECT_ID and HUB_ID are correct
- Check ACC project permissions
- Try "Clear Cache & Refresh"

**"Extraction timeout"**
- Increase EXTRACTION_DELAY_SECONDS
- Increase MAX_RETRIES_PER_MODEL
- Check model file integrity

### Debug Mode
Enable verbose logging:
1. Click "Debug Logging: OFF" ‚Üí "ON"
2. View detailed console output
3. Check extraction element details

## üìà Performance Tips

### Large Deployments
- Use profiles for recurring audits
- Enable caching (default 7 days)
- Adjust MAX_CONCURRENT_WORKERS based on system

### Network Optimization
